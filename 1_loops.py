# Example Practice:
# Given this list of fruits:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
print(len(fruits))
# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to print each fruit on a new line.
print(fruits[0])
print(fruits[1])
print(fruits[2])
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
# i just worked with loops

# Given a list of school subjects:
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "History", "Art"]
print(len(subjects))
for subject in subjects:
    print(subject)


# Challenge:
# Use a for loop and range to print each subject along with its index:
# Example output: "Subject 0: Math"
for subject in subjects:
    if subject == "History"
    break
print(subject)
for subject in subjects:
    if subject == "Science":
        continue
    print(subject)
    for index in range(len(subject)):
        print("Subject" + str(index) + ";" subjects[index])



# Given:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]

# Challenge:
# Use a for loop to add all the numbers and print the total.
total = 0
for number in numbers:
    total += number
print("total" , total)

new_numbers = list(range(1, 600001))
